                    <h4>1. About WebPlug</h4>
                    <p>
                        Webplug is a webhooks as a service infrastructure that aims to provide a template for managing
                        webhooks for users of a service.
                    </p>
                    <p>You would typically create a service which can be regarded as an application and then you can
                        register event types that your users may be interested in receiving notifications for.
                        Let's say you are a payment provider and you provide services for businesses to create cards for
                        their users. You would have some event types that a user can subscribe to; for example,
                        card_issued, card_debited or card_credited.
                        Whenever a user performs an operation on their card, you want the business to receive a
                        notification at whatever endpoint they have subscribed to for each event type,
                        so that they can then perform extra business logic for each user. This is a typical use case for
                        webplug.</p>
                    <p>Webplug is built on top of AWS and provides a CLI app for you to deploy the infrastructure to an
                        AWS account of your choice, there's also a command to destroy the infrastructure off your AWS
                        account. Lastly we provide a management UI built with shadcn/tailwind you can modify based on
                        your requirements</p>

                    <h4>2. What are webhooks?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Webhooks are a mechanism for automating the flow of information between web applications in
                        real-time. They allow one application to send data to another in a push-based manner, triggering
                        events and enabling real-time communication. Webhooks are commonly used in scenarios where
                        immediate or near real-time updates are required, such as in notifications, integrations, and
                        automation workflows.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="case-2-1">
                    <h4 class="sub">2.1. Alternatives to webhooks</h4>
                    <p>Webhoooks are not the only approach to real-time communication in software applications. There
                        are alternatice technologies and patterns that serve similar purposes. One of the major
                        differences between webhooks and other types of real real-time communication types is that
                        webhooks are omni-directional. This section outlines a
                        few of them:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li style="list-style-type:decimal;"><b style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 1.1rem">
                                Web-Sockets:
                            </b>
                            Web Sockets provide full-duplex communication channels over a single, long-lived connection.
                            They are designed for real-time bidirectional communication, making them suitable for
                            applications requiring low-latency updates. Some of the use cases include: real-time chat
                            applications, live updated, collaborative editing.
                        </li>

                            </b>
                            Polling involves regularly checking a server for updates. Clients make periodic requeses to
                            the server, asking if there are any new events or data. Long polling is a variant where the
                            server holds the request open until new data is available.
                        </li>

                            SSE is a simple and efficient mechanism for sending updates from a server to a client over a
                            single HTTP connection. It allows servers to push data to web clients over HTTP in
                            real-time. Some of the use cases include: News feeds, live score updates, stock tickers.

                        There are a couple services that currently use webhooks on a large scale. A couple of them

                            </b>
                            Github provides webhooks to notify external systems about events in a repository. For
                            example, you can set up a webhooks to receive notifications about new commits, pull
                            requests, or issues.
                            <p>This was the major inspiration behind webplug. I made use of github webhooks when setting

                                a CI/CD pipeline with AWS Codebuild and AWS Codepipeline and started to brainstorm on
                                how I
                                could abstract the functionality into a stand alone service.</p>

                    <h4>4. How does Webplug work?</h4>
                    <p>This session explains everything that happens from client to server side communication.</p>
                    <p>Webplug mainly makes use of SNS to manage message delivery. The reason for this choice is because
                        SNS can fanout messages to multiple subscribers and also automatically handles message delivery
                        retries.
                    </p>
                    <p>The steps involved in the process flow include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            A new service is created
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A user is created and registered under the service
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Event types are created for the service. Whenever there is a request to create a new event
                            type, we create an SNS topic to represent the event type.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A user subscribes specific endpoints to particular event types. We retreive the SNS topic
                            for the event type and create a new subscription with the endpoint.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            SNS sends a confirm subscription payload to the endpoint, you would need to copy the
                            subscribe url and paste in a new tab to confirm the subscription so that future messages
                            would be delivered.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Whenever a new message is published for that event type, SNS would automatically send the
                            message to all subscribers (endpoints) of that topic (event type).
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>5. Webplug JS Client</h4>
                    <p>A JS client was built to expose methods to communicate with the various modules. This includes
                        methods for the service, users, subscriptions, event types and events module.</p>

                    <h4>6. Webplug CLI app</h4>
                    <p>A cli app was built to deploy and destroy the infrastructure on your AWS account as well as spin
                        up the management UI.
                        Information on how to install and use the cli app is specified in the <a
                            href="https://temporal-stork-160.notion.site/Webplug-Documentation-2a208d2620864246a6494fb36cfe6dbe?pvs=4"

                    <p>The steps involved in deploying the infrastructure is as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The cdk code is cloned from the github repository
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The code for the management UI is cloned from the github repository
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The code for the lambda functions is cloned from the github repository
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            When the deploy command is run, cdk references the lambda functions from the server
                            directory which is where the cloned lambda functions are saved. Once the deployment is
                            completed, cdk writes the api gateway url and api key id which can be used to retreive the
                            api key itself to the outputs.json file. These variables are then saved to the .env file in
                            the management UI codebase.
